**What are the odds?** is a random number game that allows players to set their fate in a randomizers hands.

## How to play
- Choose a friend and ask them "What are the odds you do x dare?"
- Input the number into the "What are the odds?" field 
- Ask them to choose a number it won't land on (or will land on if they want to do the dare!)
- Input the number into the "What is your guess?" field
- Press the "Test your luck" button and watch as the generator selects a number between 1 and the number you provided
- If the number you guessed it would land on is equal to the one generated, you must execute the dare! (whether it be good or bad)
- If the number you guessed did **NOT** equal to the one generated you are safe to not complete the dare!
